High level description
Show images of common things (objects, animals, body parts, colors)
Let the user write the word in a drawing box
If answer is correct, gets a point/reward
If answer is not correct, show the incorrect part, and the user tries again

Features
Chose language in which user plays: writes in english/french/russian/chinese (can be extended further)
Optional: let the user play/replay a sound corresponding to the word (hint in case doesn't know translation etc)

App design
Buttons: "Erase", "Submit", "Play sound"(optional), "Solution", "Next"

Gamification elements
Pass levels similar to comnist. Could include images specific to country, i.e. not reuse the same images for each language

API
Send image(in) + word(in) + language through HTTP POST.
Get back word(out) recognized by application and image(out) 
if word(in) and word(out) don't match then image(out) highlights the mistakes, otherwise it is similar to word(in)

Need your suggesion 
how to best record the words/image/sounds? Should it be an xml or json file? In any case it should be extendable easily


Medium term thoughts:
Develop an app focused on alphabet learning based on words common to all three languages, e.g. TIGER/TIGRE/ТИГР


Long terms thoughts:
Enable users to logon to record progresses
